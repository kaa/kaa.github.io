<p>So I had to try making a <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/">Greasemonkey</a> script, to meet the challenge presented earlier. Working with Greasemonkey was extremely easy and a thoroughly pleasant experience, I simply love how slick and unobtrusive the plugin is.</p>
<p>The script will automatically detect that you are viewing a category listing on <a href="http://huuto.net">Huuto.net</a>. It will then fetch images for each item by requesting the detailed page and extracting the full image link. It will also make the image clickable so that you can simply click the image to view the larger image.</p>
<p>Now there are naturally moral implications to this little hack, Huuto charges the bidder for the extra exposure the image will give them in the listing and the site is hit quite a number of requests when compiling the list . But given how extremely underdeveloped and forgotten the site is, I dont feel too bad - they need the wakeup call!</p>
<p>Get it while it&#8217;s hot!<br/><a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/37630"><a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/37630">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/37630</a></a></p>
