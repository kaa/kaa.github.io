title: I can't stand languages that use '_' characters!
layout: post

<p>This is one of my pet peeves. Language with prolific use of the underscore character. I have many times looked at Ruby to see what all the fuss is about and never gotten past all those damn underscores. <b>I will never use a language that relies on underscore</b> as a word boundary.</p>
<p><b>Underscore is not a space</b>, it doesn&#8217;t look like a space so why bother trying? Instead it <b>breaks logical units</b> such as variable names or function names into units that may or may not belong together. By skimming I cant tell if that is a . (dot) deference or just a pseudo word boundary. Further more it <b>slows down typing</b> because you have to move your fingers way out of the normal flow.</p>
<p><b>Camelcasing is tried, tested and found divine</b>, stop messing with it.</p>
<p>This latest rant was brought on by the <a href="http://jania.pe.kr/aw/moin.cgi/JSSpec">JSSpec framework</a> for unit testing in Javascript, which I am <b>considering forking</b> because of the underscores.</p>
<p>Next week, possibly a rant on the curly bracket character, and why it is impossible to type reliably on scandinavian keyboards. Stop using it too!</p>
